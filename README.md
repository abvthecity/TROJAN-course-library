# TROJAN Course API

TROJAN Course API is fast, asyncronous, unofficial course catalogue API that can be used to develop course tools for USC with javascript.

## Version 2 is coming soon. The following will no longer apply soon.

## Basic usage
```javascript
  const TROJAN = require('TROJAN');

  // TROJAN.method_name(callback, valobject) // PARAMETERS
  //
  // TROJAN.term(console.log) // ['20152','20153','20161']
  // TROJAN.current_term(console.log) // 20161
  // TROJAN.dept_raw(console.log, {term: "20161"}) // each department
  ....
```

Since the entire API runs asynchronously, the methods do not directly return any value.
This means ```var term = TROJAN.term()``` WILL NOT work.
Instead, each method will return


## Methods
* term
* current_term
* dept_raw
* school
* dept
* dept_info
* course_raw
* course
* sect

### term
The callback(terms) recieves an array of active terms in the database (usually the past 3 terms).

### current_term
The callback(term) recieves the current term as a string. eg. "20161"

### dept_raw
The callback(school) recieves ONE object of each school, which contains an object of each nested department.

**Value Parameters**

* ```{term: "####"}``` *current term is default*

**Example object**

```javascript
{ code: 'FINE',
  name: 'Roski School of Art and Design',
  type: 'Y',
  department:
   [ { code: 'ART', name: 'Art', type: 'N' },
     { code: 'CRIT', name: 'Critical Studies', type: 'N' },
     { code: 'DES', name: 'Design', type: 'N' },
     { code: 'FA', name: 'Fine Arts', type: 'C' },
     { code: 'FACE', name: 'Ceramics', type: 'C' },
     { code: 'FACS', name: 'Critical Studies', type: 'C' },
     { code: 'FADN', name: 'Design', type: 'C' },
     { code: 'FADW', name: 'Drawing', type: 'C' },
     { code: 'FAIN', name: 'Intermedia', type: 'N' },
     { code: 'FAPH', name: 'Photography', type: 'C' },
     { code: 'FAPT', name: 'Painting', type: 'N' },
     { code: 'FAPR', name: 'Printmaking', type: 'N' },
     { code: 'FASC', name: 'Sculpture', type: 'N' },
     { code: 'PAS', name: 'Public Art Studies', type: 'N' } ] }
```
*IMPORTANT: dept_raw repeats for EACH school, asynchronously*

### school
Based on the value parameters, the callback will recieve different types of data:

* ```{term: "####"}``` *current term is default*
* ```TROJAN.school((school)=>{/* */})``` *Alias of <b>dept_raw</b>.*
* ```TROJAN.school((school)=>{/* */},{school: "AAAA"})``` *Filtered by school (returns 1 object)*
* ```TROJAN.school((code)=>{/* */},{justcode: true})``` *code = string of each school code, asynchronous for each, e.g. "FINE"*

### dept
Based on the value parameters, the callback will recieve different types of data:

* ```{term: "####"}``` *current term is default*
* ```TROJAN.dept((dept)=>{/* */})``` *Returns object ```{ code: 'ARTL', name: 'Arts Leadership', type: 'N' }```, asynchronous for each dept*
* ```TROJAN.dept((dept)=>{/* */}, {school: "AAAA"})``` *Filtered by school, asynchronous for each dept*
* ```TROJAN.dept((code)=>{/* */}, {justcode: true})``` *code = string of each department code, asynchronous for each, e.g. "CSCI"*

### dept_info
The callback will recieve the object of each department's information, asyncronously for each department.

* ```{term: "####"}``` *current term is default*
* ```{dept: "AAAA"}``` *filters to show object of one department*

### course_raw
This function sends different types of data depending on value parameter, but will **NOT** work without either the dept or justcode parameters. Please include either, or both.

* ```{term: "####"}``` *current term is default*
* ```{dept: "AAAA"}``` *object of course data, example below.*
* ```{justcode: true}``` *only the string for course ID, e.g. "CSCI-140", will be sent. It will repeat for all courses for all departments if a dept is not provided.

**Course data object example**
```javascript
{ IsCrossListed: 'N',
  PublishedCourseID: 'CSCI-794D',
  ScheduledCourseID: 'CSCI-794D',
  CourseData:
   { prefix: 'CSCI',
     number: '794',
     sequence: 'D',
     suffix: {},
     title: 'Doctoral Dissertation',
     description: 'Credit on acceptance of Dissertation. Graded CR/NC.',
     units: '2.0',
     restriction_by_major: {},
     restriction_by_class: ' Registration open to the following class level(s): Doctoral Student',
     restriction_by_school: {},
     CourseNotes: {},
     CourseTermNotes: {},
     prereq_text: 'CSCI-794c',
     coreq_text: {},
     SectionData: { ... } } }
 ```

### course
Will send to callback one object of the data of the selected course.

* ```{term: "####"}``` *current term is default*
* ```{course: "AAAA-###"}``` *(<b>REQUIRED</b>) works even if there is a letter sequence attached to the end, e.g. "CSCI-140L"*

### sect
Will send to callback different types of data, provided that a course is selected.

* ```{term: "####"}``` *current term is default*
* ```{course: "AAAA-###"}``` *(<b>REQUIRED</b>) sends the object of each section's information within the course*
* ```{sect: "#####"}``` *Filters the sections to one object*
* ```{justcode: true}``` *Returns only the string of the ID of each section, although only useful when {sect} has no value.*
